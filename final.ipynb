    "For the final project, we used a variety of professional websites to calculate data concerning Intelligence Analysis related job postings. We will then use the computer application Tableau and program matlab to create visualizations of this data suitable for further analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    "In order to collect data for the project, we used a variety of websites that contain job posting for Intelligence Analysts. Several job postings will come from government agencies like the CIA, FBI, NSA. Several more will come from government hiring portals like USAJobs and IntelligenceCareers. We gathered the most data from these sources since it provided us with the most relevant information to our areas of interest. Beyond the use of government websites, we searched more accessible professional websites such as Linkedin and Handshake to gather more reliable information from sources vetted by professionals or universities. Other supplemental websites such as Snagajob and Indeed were used in order to find analyst positions not inherently tied to the government. These companies included Arteza, Wells States Healtcare, and Leidos. Overall, our goal in this project was to use a wide range of sources to find job postings related to both the government and private sector of intelligence analysis.  \n",

We found that most of the dates were around early to mid-April, which is when we found the data. This may be due to agencies' removal ofjob postings after the position has been filled. There was also a few jobs posted in 2018 from large companies with constant need of people. "

    "In conclusion, we were able to successfully use python to break down different aspects of intelligence positions. Through the use of pandas we created excel files and printed the data into Jupyter Notebook. With the Counter method, we found common job titles, duties, and skills related to the intelligence analysis major. With Matplotlib we used mathematical equations to find correlations and averages for salaries and levels of experience for this position. We used data visuailization methods like Tableau and numpy to create graphs for this data. However, there were limitations to this project. These limitations include our lack of experience using panda meant were unable to clean the data to fullest extent. Furthermore, personal limitations, such as not understanding the intricacies of certain coding mechanisms significantly slowed down the process. We could improve this project by finding a wider variety of positions outside the government sector. The data collected could also be found from older posting in order to reduce potential bias and misrepresentation of hiring seasons. Overall, however, we found this project to be useful in our understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebook since we had to independently consolidate the information we learned throughout the semester to complete this project. This project shows the proficiency gained from the programming class this year. Through this project we were also able to observe how python can be realistically applied to our future career goals.
